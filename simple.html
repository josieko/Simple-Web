         <h3>HTML aka the 🦴</h3> 

         <div class="flex-container">
         <p>
            <h4><u>What is it</u></h4> 
            
            - HTML is a (HyperText) Markup language that is not really considered a coding language. 
            <br>
            - Used to structure webpage content, as the skeleton, it defines how the elements should be displayed
            <br>
            - It is best known for the < > brackets that are used to define HTML elements
            <br>
            <br>

            <h4><u>What is it good for</u></h4>
           
            - It’s good for creating web page structures, email templates and online forms
            <br>
            <br>

            <h4><u>What is it not good for</u></h4>
            
            - It’s not good for styling web pages and that’s where CSS comes in,
             and the same thing with interactivity, where JavaScript is used to fill that gap
            <br>
            - HTML was intended to be a simple markup language with a focus on structuring and presenting content. 
            - The simplicity of it is both a strength (for it being simple and accessible) and a weakness 
            in terms of it not having capabilities for more complex tasks. 
            That’s why it is used in combination with languages like CSS (to style and format HTML content), 
            JS (to add interactivity), or even SQL (to process and manipulate data)
            <br>
            <br>

            <h4><u>Who uses it</u></h4>
           
            - It’s a widely spread language that anyone can use to create a web page, 
            from professional web devs, content creators, and bloggers or it could be for a hobby
            <br>
            <br>

            <h4><u>Companies that implement it</u></h4>
           
            - Any company, business or individual having a website, that website uses HTML so it is pretty much a base for it all.
            <br>
            - Everyone uses it, from Google, Amazon and Apple to Netflix, Spotify, Wikipedia and the list goes on
            <br>
            <br>

            <h4><u>Cool TikTok finds and tools</u></h4>
            
            <a href="http://html5up.net"> 🐚 HTML5up</a> - Website with free downloadable templates
            <br>
            - Emmet (integrated in VS Code) allows you to be faster by typing just the name of the element, 
            by typing enter you get the opening and closing tags without manually writing them
           <br>
           <br>

            <h4><u>Fun facts</u></h4>
           
            - HTML is the oldest markup language on the web and it was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, the same guy who invented WWW
            - The world’s first web page was written in it
        </p>
            <br>
            <br>

        </div>


        <h3>CSS aka the 👘</h3>
        <div class="flex-container">
        <p>
            <h4><u>What is it</u> </h4>
            
            - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used to style and describe how will the website be presented. 
            That includes colors, fonts and layouts
            <br>
            <br>

            <h4><u>What is it good for</u></h4>
           
            - It’s good to style and control the look of the page, 
            and this includes controlling the layout of the page, the appearance of text, images, 
            links and other elements like tables, forms or buttons            
            <br>
            <br>

            <h4><u>What is it not good for</u></h4>
            
            - Like HTML, CSS is used in combination with other languages to complement them, 
            and it isn’t good for defining the structure of the page or interactivity.
            <br>
            - This is because it is primarily a styling language, 
            not designed to handle complexities such as data manipulation or interactivity
            <br>
            - Although it is set to control layouts of pages, 
            CSS can struggle with extremely complex animations 
            (for example a 3D product viewer with options to rotate and zoom) and in cases like that, 
            CSS might not perform well. That’s where specialized libraries come in like GSAP, 
            Anime.js or TweenMax, and WebGL libraries like Three.js, Babylon.js or A-Frame
            <br>
            - All of the libraries from above can be used to create complex animations on mobiles as well.
            <br>
            <br>

            <h4><u>Who uses it</u></h4>
           
            - Just like HTML, anyone who makes or has a website, business or individual,
            will use CSS to style the appearance of their website             
            <br>
            <br>

            <h4><u>Cool TikTok finds and tools</u></h4>
           

            <a href="https://neumorphism.io"> 🦪 Neuomorphism</a> - Website used to generate CSS code for buttons, 
            physical objects or materials

            - The first CSS property was font-family
            <br>
            - It was first introduced in 1996
